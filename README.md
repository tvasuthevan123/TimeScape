# TimesScape

TimeScape is a cross-platform application (developed for my third year individual project for a Computer Science BSc Hons at the University of Southampton) meant to provide a minimal time-management solution for students that currently isn't available on the mobile phone market.

Using custom Material guideline inspired design, and a prototype for prioritisation/scheduling automation, this serves as a starting point for an application that will act more as an smart assistant for users rather than a "port" of analogue methods like diaries and whiteboards.
